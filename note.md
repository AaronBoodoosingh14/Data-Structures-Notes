# Data Structures 

The Data Structures course focuses on expanding our basic python skills and learning how to represent data better. These skills are crucial for all programmers as they make their leap from beginner to intermediate programmers.

## Matrices & List Comprehension 

A Matrix is a representation of numbers, symbols, expressions in 2 dimensional array. In python data structures can be made allowing us to have values in rows and columns, we can do this by making a list inside of a list.

There is no data structure called a "Matrix" instead we have to follow a set of rules when making a list inside of a list they are as followd.

* All rows must have the same number of values

* All columns must have the same number of values 

* All items in the 2D list must have the same data types

* SInce indexing always starts at 0, row 1 is technically located at matrix[0]

### Example of Matrix 

```python

Matrix_A = [ 
    [1,2,3,4],
    [5,6,7,8]
]

print('Row 1: %s' % matrix_a[0]) 
print('value at row 2 column 2: %s' % matrix_a[1][1])

```

## List Comprehension In Python 3 

List comprehension is concise method to create a list

We use this technique when:

* Te list is a result of some operations applied to all its items, 

* Its made from another form of iterable data 

* The list is a memeber of another form of iterable data that satifies a certain condition

### List Example 1:

Old Method: 

```python

squares = []
for i in range(10):
    squares.append(i ** 2)

print('Our result: %s' % squares)
```
New method: 
```python 
squares = [i**2 for i in range(10)]

print('Our new result: %s' % squares)
```
### List Example of 3:

```python 

vec = [[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]]

result = [value for row in vec for value in row]
print('Vec as a single list of values: %s' % result)
```
It is important to note that the order of your clauses matter

# Lesson 2: Map and Filter

## The Map Function

The map function is to apply a function to iterable data

### Formating
```python 
map(function_name, sequence) 

-- function_name: any function (built-in or selfmade) that returns a desired value of choice
-- sequence: any iterable data type

```
### Example 

```python

def square(num):
    ''' squares the given num argument '''
    return num ** 2
# end of square

array = list(range(1,11))
square_array = list(map(square, array))

print('Original Array:', array)
print('Array Squared:', square_array)

```
An important thing to note is that the map function doesn't return a specific data type, instead a some form of iterable data, meaning after we apply the function we use a list function on it. 

Its not needed to use methods with a map, since there is a high probability that there is already a method for what is needed. 

## Filter function 

The filter function is to filter out items from a data set that meets a certain condition. 

### Formatting

```python
filter(bool_returning_function, sequence)

-- function: The function name we provide for filter() must be return a boolean value ... should also be able handle the items inside the sequence as its arguments
-- sequence: any iterable data type
```
### Example: 

```python 

def isOdd(x):
    ''' isOdd() returns True if x is odd.'''
    return x % 2 != 0

array = list(range(1,101))
odds = list(filter(isOdd, array))

print('Odd Numbers from 1 to 100:', odds)

```

### Example problem: list of Palindromic numbers: 

```python
def isPalindrome(x):
    ''' isPalindrome returns True if string X is a palindrome.'''
    return x == x[::-1]

array = list(range(1,10000))

palindromic_numbers = list(map(int, filter(isPalindrome, map(str, array))))
print('Palindromic Numbers from 1 to 10,000', palindromicNumbers)
```

## Lesson 3: Tuples

Strings and list are very similar data types with some key differences, these differences can cause it to be annoying. But when using a tuple all these issues 

## How to use tuples: 

* Tuples are declared with parenthesis ()
* () is an empty tuple
* (50,) is a singleton tuple, the comma is required
* Tuples are sliceable, therefore indexxable using square brackets

### Example: 

```python

tup = ('C', ' Java', 'Python')
empty_tup = ()
single_tup = ('Park',)

print(tup)
print(empty_tup)
print(single_tup)

```

### Tuple Operators: 

```python

# Concatenation: Joining two tuples
a = (1,2,3)
b = (4,5,6)
concat_result = a + b
print('a+b:', concat_result)


# Repetition: Repeating a list multiple times
c = ('Hi!',)
repet_result = c * 3
print('c*3', repet_result)

# Membership: Check if a value exists in a tuple
d = a + b + c
print('d:', d)
print('\'Hi!\' in d:', 'Hi!' in d)
print('7 in d:', 7 in d)

```
Tuples are iterable, indexable and sliceable

### Packing and Unpacking 

* Packing collect multiple variableâ€™s values and assign it to a single variable

* Unpacking help us assign certain values from a tuple to different variables

* This becomes very useful skill when combined with variable arguments for Function Definition and Function Calls

```python
# Examine the following code

# Packing
var_1 = 2
var_2 = 3
var_3 = 5

prime = var_1, var_2, var_3

print('Packed prime values:', prime)

# Unpacking and Repacking
fib = (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8)

fib_0, fib_1, fib_n = fib[0], fib[1], fib[2:]
print('fib_0:', fib_0)
print('fib_1:', fib_1)
print('fib_n:', fib_n)
```
